This letter is a Notice of Infringement as authorized in ยง512(c) of the U.S. Copyright Law.</p>

<p>I am the copyright owner of the works and the following is true and accurate.</p>

<p>1. The original work, for which I claim copyright, is distributed by me to my students for their sole individual use:</p>
