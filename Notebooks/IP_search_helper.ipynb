    "The Course Hero website allows students to upload materials to assist other students. Unfortunately, this may include items which violate their instructors' intellectual property rights. Course Hero professes a commitment to protecting intellectual property and provides an easy to use webform (https://www.coursehero.com/copyright-infringement/) to request the removal of infringing materials. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the site does not seem to standardize the names / abbreviations for departments and courses, and it uses the uploading student's favored spelling of the instructor's name. This makes it difficult for an instructor to be sure they've checked all materials which might belong to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tool which automates the process of searching the site to help me more easily keep tabs on my intellectual property.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is thus extremely rough and probably not very user friendly. That said, I am making them public in case others find them useful.  \n",

    "Please note that each step will take several seconds to run as the tool queries the Course Hero site. I didn't add any progress notifications, so it may seem to be frozen. Please be patient while it's working --if you click buttons before the previous search has finished, you may discover why I said it's not entirely user friendly. \n",

    "When the search completes, it will display buttons with all the departments found for the campus. Select all the departments you want to search for materials from. That will initiate a search for courses associated with those departments; from there you'll be able to select files students have uploaded for those courses.\n",
